    "### Step 1: Install MetaMask\n",
    "1. **Go to the MetaMask website**: Open your browser and navigate to [https://metamask.io](https://metamask.io).\n",
    "2. **Download the MetaMask Extension**: Click the download button, and select the appropriate extension for your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Brave).\n",
    "3. **Install the Extension**: Follow the on-screen prompts to add the MetaMask extension to your browser.\n",
    "4. **Open MetaMask**: Once installed, click on the MetaMask icon in your browser toolbar to open it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Create a New Wallet\n",
    "1. **Get Started**: Click \"Get Started\" on the MetaMask welcome screen.\n",
    "2. **Create a New Wallet**:\n",
    "   - Click \"Create a Wallet.\"\n",
    "   - Set a secure password. This password is needed to unlock MetaMask on your device.\n",
    "   - **Backup your Secret Recovery Phrase**: MetaMask will generate a 12-word seed phrase (Secret Recovery Phrase). Write this down and store it in a secure place. Do not share this phrase with anyone, as it can give access to your wallet.\n",
    "3. **Complete Setup**: After confirming your Secret Recovery Phrase, your wallet setup will be complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Study Spending Ether per Transaction\n",
    "1. **Understanding Gas Fees**:\n",
    "   - Ether (ETH) is spent for each transaction as \"gas fees,\" which compensate miners for processing and validating transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.\n",
    "   - The gas fee is based on the network demand, transaction complexity, and speed at which you want your transaction processed.\n",
    "2. **Viewing Transaction Fees**:\n",
    "   - When you make a transaction in MetaMask, it will show the estimated gas fee for that transaction.\n",
    "   - You can choose between \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" and \"High\" fees, which affect the transaction speed.\n",
    "3. **Analyze Gas Prices and Costs**:\n",
    "   - For hands-on study, try making a small transaction on the Ethereum test network (e.g., Rinkeby, Goerli) to see how gas fees vary.\n",
    "   - You can also use gas tracking tools (e.g., [Etherscan Gas Tracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker)) to monitor gas prices over time and understand fee fluctuations."
